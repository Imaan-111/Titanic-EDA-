# Titanic-EDA-
Exploratory data analysis of Titanic dataset using R

## Overview

This project explores the Titanic passenger dataset to understand factors affecting survival during the disaster. Using R and tidyverse tools, we clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover patterns related to sex, age, passenger class, and fare paid.

## Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset  
- Explore survival rates by key demographics and socioeconomic factors  
- Visualize data distributions and survival trends  
- Draw insights to better understand survival determinants

## Tools & Libraries Used

- R programming language  
- `dplyr` for data manipulation  
- `ggplot2` for visualization  
- `titanic` dataset package  
- `rmarkdown` for report generation


## Future work suggestions 
-Perform more detailed modeling using logistic regression or machine learning to predict survival.
-Explore family size impact using SibSp and Parch variables.
-Analyze impact of embarkation points with geographic context.
-Investigate additional variables such as ticket groups or cabin location, if data quality allows.
